# Amazon PPC Trends Every Seller Must Know in 2025

Amazon's advertising platform is evolving fast. Here's what's working now and what you need to change.

## Major PPC Shifts in 2025

### 1. AI-Powered Bidding is Now Essential

Amazon's algorithm has gotten smarter. Manual bidding is leaving money on the table.

**What to do:**
- Use Dynamic Bidding (Down Only) for new campaigns
- Switch to Dynamic Bidding (Up and Down) after 30 days of data
- Let AI optimize based on conversion probability

### 2. Sponsored Display Cannibalization

SD campaigns are now stealing sales from organic rankings.

**The fix:**
- Run SD only on competitor ASINs
- Exclude your own brand from targeting
- Use audience targeting, not product targeting

### 3. Video Ads = Higher ROAS

Sponsored Brand Video ads are seeing 2-3x better conversion than static images.

**Action items:**
- Create 15-30 second product videos
- Show product in use, not just features
- Add captions (85% watch without sound)

### 4. DSP Now Accessible to Mid-Size Sellers

Amazon's Demand Side Platform isn't just for big brands anymore.

**Minimum spend dropped to $5,000/month**

Best uses:
- Retargeting website visitors
- Audience lookalikes
- Off-Amazon advertising

## What's NOT Working Anymore

❌ Broad match keywords without negative sculpting  
❌ Set-it-and-forget-it campaigns  
❌ Bidding on your own brand terms (usually)  
❌ Running ads without A/B testing creative  
❌ Ignoring placement reports
