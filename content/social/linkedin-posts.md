### Post 1: Monday
**Hook:** I fired my $2,500/month VA and replaced her with AI.

**Body:**
Best decision I made for my Amazon business.

She was great, but:
• Needed training (3 months)
• Took holidays (4 weeks/year)
• Made mistakes when tired
• Couldn't scale with my growth

My AI assistant:
• Works 24/7/365
• Never makes the same mistake twice
• Scales instantly
• Costs 1/10th the price

The future of Amazon selling isn't outsourcing to humans.

It's AI + expert oversight.

Who else is using AI to run their e-commerce business?

### Post 2: Wednesday
**Hook:** Amazon just changed their algorithm again.

**Body:**
Most sellers won't notice until their sales drop.

Here's what's happening:

1. Review weighting is shifting toward "verified purchase"
2. A9 is prioritizing products with video content
3. PPC costs are up 23% YoY for broad match
4. Inventory performance score affects ranking more

The sellers winning in 2025?

They're using AI to monitor these changes in real-time.

Not waiting for their monthly VA report.

I built a system that alerts me within 1 hour of any account metric change.

Game changer.

Want the blueprint? DM me "ALERT" and I'll send it.

### Post 3: Friday
**Hook:** 47 AI systems built. Here's what actually works.

**Body:**
After building AI automation for 100+ Amazon sellers, patterns emerge.

The winners focus on these 5 areas:

1. Price monitoring (competitor tracking)
2. Inventory alerts (avoid stockouts)
3. Review management (responds in <1 hour)
4. Account health (catch issues early)
5. Reporting (daily metrics, not monthly)

The losers?

They try to automate *everything* on day one.

Start with one system. Perfect it. Then add another.

My 30-day AI implementation roadmap:

Week 1: Price monitoring
Week 2: Inventory alerts
Week 3: Review management
Week 4: Integration & optimization

What's the first thing you'd automate in your business?
