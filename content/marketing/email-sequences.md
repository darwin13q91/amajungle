### Email 2: Mistake to Avoid (Day 2)

**Subject:** The #1 AI mistake costing sellers $10K+

Hi [First Name],

Yesterday you downloaded the AI Automation Blueprint.

Today I want to share the biggest mistake I see:

**Trying to automate everything at once.**

I get it. The promise of AI is tempting.

But here's what happens:
• Week 1: Set up 10 systems
• Week 2: Half break, you're overwhelmed
• Week 3: Abandon everything, go back to manual
• Week 4: Conclude "AI doesn't work for my business"

**The right approach:**
Start with ONE system. Master it. Then add another.

From the Blueprint, pick ONE of these:
1. Price monitoring
2. Inventory alerts
3. Review management

Implement just that this week.

Next week, add the second.

By week 4, you'll have 4 working systems instead of 10 broken ones.

**Need help choosing which to start with?**

### Email 3: Tool Stack (Day 3)

**Subject:** The $47/month tool stack (vs $2,500 VA)

Hi [First Name],

Let's talk tools.

You don't need a $10,000 enterprise system to automate your Amazon business.

Here's the stack I recommend to clients:

**Essential (Under $100/month):**
• Keepa ($17/mo) - Price monitoring
• SellerBoard ($19/mo) - Profit analytics
• Feedback Genius ($40/mo) - Review requests
• Amajungle AI ($47/mo) - Full automation suite

**Total: $123/month**

Vs. a VA at $2,500/month

**The ROI:**
• Save 25 hours/week
• Catch issues before they cost you money
• Scale without hiring
• Sleep better knowing AI is watching 24/7

**Advanced (Add when ready):**
• Helium 10 ($99/mo) - Keyword research
• Pacvue ($500+/mo) - PPC automation
• Perpetua ($400+/mo) - AI advertising

Start simple. Scale smart.

**Want me to set this up for you?**

I offer a "Done-For-You AI Implementation" service:
• Full tool stack setup
• Custom automation workflows
• 30-day support
• 30-day money-back guarantee

Or just reply with your biggest time drain, and I'll recommend the right tool.

Cheers,
Darwin

### Email 4: Case Study (Day 4)

**Subject:** How Mike saved $48,000/year with AI

Hi [First Name],

Meet Mike.

He runs a 7-figure Amazon business with 47 SKUs.

**His problem:**
Spending 35 hours/week on operational tasks.
• Monitoring competitor prices
• Managing inventory levels
• Responding to customer messages
• Pulling reports for decisions

He had 2 VAs. Total cost: $4,800/month.

**The breaking point:**
His best VA quit to start her own business.

He came to me asking: "Can AI really replace my team?"

**What we did:**

Month 1: Implemented price monitoring AI
- Saved 8 hours/week
- Caught 3 price wars early

Month 2: Added inventory automation
- Zero stockouts (vs 2-3/month before)
- Optimized reorder points

Month 3: Customer service AI
- Response time: <1 hour (vs 8 hours)
- CSAT score: 4.8/5 (vs 4.2/5)

Month 4: Reporting dashboard
- Daily metrics, not monthly
- Data-driven decisions

**The results after 6 months:**
• Reduced to 1 part-time VA ($800/month)
• AI automation cost: $600/month
• **Total savings: $48,000/year**
• Mike's time freed up: 25 hours/week

Now he focuses on:
• Product development
• Market expansion
• Strategic partnerships

The stuff that actually grows his business.

**Could this work for you?**

Every business is different. But if you're spending 15+ hours/week on Amazon operations, there's probably $20K+ in savings waiting.
